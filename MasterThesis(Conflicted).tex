\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
\epigraph{\textit{``Begin at the beginning,'' the King said, gravely, ``and go on till you
come to an end; then stop.''}}{--- Lewis Carroll, \textit{Alice in Wonderland}}


\newthought{Not only is} the title of this project fairly broad, so are the subjects covered in this thesis. The overall goal of this project is to apply machine learning to different datasets and see how well these comparatively new tools might improve classical statistical methods. The project have dealt with two (seemingly) very different datasets: Danish housing prices and Quark-Gluon discrimination in particle physics, and the aim of this section is to provide an initial overview of the scope and relationship of the two sub-projects; two sub-projects which are covered in each part of this book. 


The first part of the thesis deals with the problem of estimating housing prices as precisely and accurately as possible. This was the sub-project that was worked on in the beginning of the overall project and worked as an initial introduction to the application of machine learning to real-life datasets. The housing prices dataset thus became the playground in which the subtleties of these new modern tools were examined, where the difference between real life datasets with all its quirks, outliers and bad formatting, and curated toy datasets that works out of the box (such as the famous Iris dataset\cite{andersonSpeciesProblemIris1936a,fisherUseMultipleMeasurements1936}) were experienced first hand. Since the project started the dataset changed due to a new collaboration with the Danish housing agency \href{www.boligsiden.dk}{Boligsiden} where the agreement was, stated shortly, that we would get their data and they would get our results. Boligsiden is a natural collaborator since they are the biggest on the market\sidenote{Due to being owned by the \q{Dansk Ejendomsmæglerforening}, The Danish Association of Chartered Estate Agents} and have been very helpful the continuos process of providing data but it also should also be noted that they have had no say on the results presented in this thesis. 
% During this initial stage, the author sparred with Simon Gudiksen\sidenote{who afterwards went on to get a job at Boligsiden.} who also worked on the same dataset, however, both projects were done independently. Where Gudiksen focussed on the prediction of the time evolution of the housing prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), my work was mostly on the different levels and methods of hyperparameter optimization with some smaller detours into Natural Language Processing (NLP) as an example. \newline


% The second part, the Quark-Gluon discrimination in particle physics, was the main part of the project. Not only was most of the time focussed on this sub-project, it was also the work that generated the highest academic output; an article based on this is in the making. This part dealt with data from the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) which was an underground particle accelerator at CERN built in 1989 and was discontinued in 2000, where the first phase (LEP1), from 1989-1995, is the sole source of data. As the name suggests it collided electrons and positrons together in what is still the largest electron-positron accelerator ever built\cite{LargeElectronPositronCollider}. During LEP1 it was primarily the decay channels of the $Z$-boson that were probed where especially the $Z\rightarrow q\bar{q}g$ and $Z \rightarrow q\bar{q}gg$ were examined in this thesis. It is especially the distributions of these gluon jets and the difference between Data\sidenote{Where \q{Data} with capital D refers to the actual, measured data and \q{data} refers to any arbitrary selection of data}   and MC that are of interests to the theoreticians that develop the MC-models. At first an improved $b$-tagging algorithm was developed based on only the vertex variables since the primary variables of interest to the theoreticians are the shape variables. Here methods and code developed in the hyperparameter optimization process from the housing prices part were used. After the improvement in the $b$-tagging model, an event-based $g$-tag model -- in comparison to the jet-based $b$-tagging model -- was implemented which (hopefully) allows one to extract useful events of interest. Having found these useful events, one can start looking at how the distributions in the relevant variables differ between Data and MC. Finally XXX \TODO.

% The thesis is structured such that chapter \autoref{ch:ML_theory} introduces the needed theoretical Machine Learning (ML) background needed for understanding the methods used throughout the thesis, chapter \autoref{ch:housing_price_analysis} describes the housing prices part of the project as mentioned above, chapter \autoref{ch:particle_physcis_LEP} introduces the basic physics in the standard model and the Lund string model which is used throughout the rest of the theses, chapter \autoref{ch:quark_gluon_analysis} explains analysis of the main project in this thesis, i.e. the quark gluon analysis, and finally the two chapters \autoref{ch:discussion_outlook} and \autoref{ch:conclusion} discusses the overall work in this thesis and concludes on it. 

% The work presented in this thesis is split up into two parts as presented above, however, it should be noted that during the analysis part of the project they were treated not as two different projects but rather as two different instances of same underlying problem: teaching computers how to find patterns in high-dimensional data automatically and should thus not be seen as two independent projects. This also highlight another key aspect of this project, that the author does not have any background in particle physics other than rudimentary knowledge stemming from an undergraduate education in general physics. 

% All of the work presented here is performed by the author unless otherwise noted.

% % \newthought{Machine Learning} is the method of teaching computers how to automatically find patterns in (often high-dimensional) data. According to some sceptics machine learning (ML) is just glorified statistics, however, by the same logic physics is just glorified mathematics. In contrary, machine learning is a set of subject located somewhere along the hypothetical line from simple, classical statistics to futuristic artificial intelligence. It includes methods ranging from the well-known statistical methods such as linear regression to the modern, advanced zoo of different neural networks.

\section{Headings}\label{sec:headings1}\index{headings}

Tufte's books include the following heading levels: parts,
chapters,\sidenote{Parts and chapters are defined for the \texttt{tufte-book}
class only.}  sections, subsections, and paragraphs.  Not defined by default
are: sub-subsections and subparagraphs.

\begin{table}[h]

      Paragraph & italic & 10/14 \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Heading styles used in \BE.}
  \label{tab:heading-styles}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Paragraph} Paragraph headings (as shown here) are introduced by
italicized text and separated from the main paragraph by a bit of space.

\chapter{Particle Physics and LEP}
\label{ch:particle_physcis_LEP}
% \immediate\write{./quote.sh \the\value{chapter}}
% \epigraph{\input{/tmp/fortune-\the\value{chapter}}}{--- \textup{\texttt{/usr/bin/fortune}}}

The \TL document classes define a style similar to the
style Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts.  Tufte's style is known
for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with
text, and well-set typography.  This document aims to be at once a
demonstration of the features of the \TL document classes
and a style guide to their use.

\section{Page Layout}\label{sec:page-layout}
\subsection{Headings}\label{sec:headings}\index{headings}
This style provides \textsc{a}- and \textsc{b}-heads (that is,
\Verb|\section| and \Verb|\subsection|), demonstrated above.

If you need more than two levels of section headings, you'll have to define
them yourself at the moment; there are no pre-defined styles for anything below
a \Verb|\subsection|.  As Bringhurst points out in \textit{The Elements of
Typographic Style}, 
% \cite{Bringhurst2005} 
you should ``use as many levels of
headings as you need: no more, and no fewer.''

The \TL classes will emit an error if you try to use
\linebreak\Verb|\subsubsection| and smaller headings.

% let's start a new thought -- a new section
\newthought{In his later books}, 
% \cite{Tufte2006}
 Tufte
starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph,
and sets the first few words of the sentence in \textsc{small caps}.  To
accomplish this using this style, use the \doccmddef{newthought} command:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{newthought}\{In his later books\}, Tufte starts\ldots
\end{docspec}



\chapter{Quark Gluon Analysis}
\label{ch:quark_gluon_analysis}

\section{Sidenotes}\label{sec:sidenotes}
One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the
extensive use of sidenotes.  There is a wide margin to provide ample room
for sidenotes and small figures.  Any \doccmd{footnote}s will automatically
be converted to sidenotes.\footnote{This is a sidenote that was entered
using the \texttt{\textbackslash footnote} command.}  If you'd like to place ancillary
information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript
number), you can use the \doccmd{marginnote} command.\marginnote{This is a
margin note.  Notice that there isn't a number preceding the note, and
there is no number in the main text where this note was written.}

The specification of the \doccmddef{sidenote} command is:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote}[\docopt{number}][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}
\end{docspec}

Both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional.  If you
provide a \docopt{number} argument, then that number will be used as the
sidenote number.  It will change of the number of the current sidenote only and
will not affect the numbering sequence of subsequent sidenotes.

Sometimes a sidenote may run over the top of other text or graphics in the
margin space.  If this happens, you can adjust the vertical position of the
sidenote by providing a dimension in the \docopt{offset} argument.  Some
examples of valid dimensions are:
\begin{docspec}
  \ttfamily 1.0in \qquad 2.54cm \qquad 254mm \qquad 6\Verb|\baselineskip|
\end{docspec}
If the dimension is positive it will push the sidenote down the page; if the
dimension is negative, it will move the sidenote up the page.

While both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional, they
must be provided in order.  To adjust the vertical position of the sidenote
while leaving the sidenote number alone, use the following syntax:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote}[][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}
\end{docspec}
The empty brackets tell the \Verb|\sidenote| command to use the default
sidenote number.

If you \emph{only} want to change the sidenote number, however, you may
completely omit the \docopt{offset} argument:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote}[\docopt{number}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}
\end{docspec}

The \doccmddef{marginnote} command has a similar \docarg{offset} argument:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{marginnote}[\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Margin note text.}\}
\end{docspec}

\section{References}
References are placed alongside their citations as sidenotes,
as well.  This can be accomplished using the normal \doccmddef{cite}
command.\sidenote{The first paragraph of this document includes a citation.}

The complete list of references may also be printed automatically by using
the \doccmddef{bibliography} command.  (See the end of this document for an
example.)  If you do not want to print a bibliography at the end of your
document, use the \doccmddef{nobibliography} command in its place.  


\section{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:figures-and-tables}
Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work.
In addition to the standard \docenvdef{figure} and \docenvdef{tabular} environments,
this style provides special figure and table environments for full-width
floats.

Full page--width figures and tables may be placed in \docenvdef{figure*} or
\docenvdef{table*} environments.  To place figures or tables in the margin,
use the \docenvdef{marginfigure} or \docenvdef{margintable} environments as follows
(see figure~\ref{fig:marginfig}):

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{helix}
  \caption{This is a margin figure.  The helix is defined by 
    $x = \cos(2\pi z)$, $y = \sin(2\pi z)$, and $z = [0, 2.7]$.  The figure was
    drawn using Asymptote (\url{http://asymptote.sf.net/}).}
  \label{fig:marginfig}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{docspec}
\textbackslash begin\{marginfigure\}\\
  \qquad\textbackslash includegraphics\{helix\}\\
  \qquad\textbackslash caption\{This is a margin figure.\}\\
  \qquad\textbackslash label\{fig:marginfig\}\\
\textbackslash end\{marginfigure\}\\
\end{docspec}

The \docenv{marginfigure} and \docenv{margintable} environments accept an optional parameter \docopt{offset} that adjusts the vertical position of the figure or table.  See the ``\nameref{sec:sidenotes}'' section above for examples.  The specifications are:
\begin{docspec}
  \textbackslash{begin\{marginfigure\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
  \qquad\ldots\\
  \textbackslash{end\{marginfigure\}}\\
  \mbox{}\\
  \textbackslash{begin\{margintable\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
  \qquad\ldots\\
  \textbackslash{end\{margintable\}}\\
\end{docspec}

Figure~\ref{fig:fullfig} is an example of the \docenv{figure*}
environment and figure~\ref{fig:textfig} is an example of the normal
\docenv{figure} environment.

\begin{figure*}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sine.pdf}%
  \caption{This graph shows $y = \sin x$ from about $x = [-10, 10]$.
  \emph{Notice that this figure takes up the full page width.}}%
  \label{fig:fullfig}%
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{hilbertcurves.pdf}
%  \checkparity This is an \pageparity\ page.%
  \caption[Hilbert curves of various degrees $n$.][6pt]{Hilbert curves of various degrees $n$. \emph{Notice that this figure only takes up the main textblock width.}}
  \label{fig:textfig}
  %\zsavepos{pos:textfig}
\end{figure}

As with sidenotes and marginnotes, a caption may sometimes require vertical
adjustment. The \doccmddef{caption} command now takes a second optional
argument that enables you to do this by providing a dimension \docopt{offset}.
You may specify the caption in any one of the following forms:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{caption}\{\docarg{long caption}\}\\
  \doccmd{caption}[\docarg{short caption}]\{\docarg{long caption}\}\\
  \doccmd{caption}[][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{long caption}\}\\
  \doccmd{caption}[\docarg{short caption}][\docopt{offset}]%
                  \{\docarg{long caption}\}
\end{docspec}
A positive \docopt{offset} will push the caption down the page. The short
caption, if provided, is what appears in the list of figures/tables, otherwise
the ``long'' caption appears there. Note that although the arguments
\docopt{short caption} and \docopt{offset} are both optional, they must be
provided in order. Thus, to specify an \docopt{offset} without specifying a
\docopt{short caption}, you must include the first set of empty brackets
\Verb|[]|, which tell \doccmd{caption} to use the default ``long'' caption. As
an example, the caption to figure~\ref{fig:textfig} above was given in the form
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{caption}[Hilbert curves...][6pt]\{Hilbert curves...\}
\end{docspec}

Table~\ref{tab:normaltab} shows table created with the \docpkg{booktabs}
package.  Notice the lack of vertical rules---they serve only to clutter
the table's data.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \fontfamily{ppl}\selectfont
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Margin & Length \\
    \midrule
    Paper width & \unit[8\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
    Paper height & \unit[11]{inches} \\
    Textblock width & \unit[6\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
    Textblock/sidenote gutter & \unit[\nicefrac{3}{8}]{inches} \\
    Sidenote width & \unit[2]{inches} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Here are the dimensions of the various margins used in the Tufte-handout class.}
  \label{tab:normaltab}
  %\zsavepos{pos:normaltab}
\end{table}

\newthought{Occasionally} \LaTeX{} will generate an error message:\label{err:too-many-floats}
\begin{docspec}
  Error: Too many unprocessed floats
\end{docspec}
\LaTeX{} tries to place floats in the best position on the page.  Until it's
finished composing the page, however, it won't know where those positions are.
If you have a lot of floats on a page (including sidenotes, margin notes,
figures, tables, etc.), \LaTeX{} may run out of ``slots'' to keep track of them
and will generate the above error.

\LaTeX{} initially allocates 18 slots for storing floats.  To work around this
limitation, the \TL document classes provide a \doccmddef{morefloats} command
that will reserve more slots.

The first time \doccmd{morefloats} is called, it allocates an additional 34
slots.  The second time \doccmd{morefloats} is called, it allocates another 26
slots.

The \doccmd{morefloats} command may only be used two times.  Calling it a
third time will generate an error message.  (This is because we can't safely
allocate many more floats or \LaTeX{} will run out of memory.)

If, after using the \doccmd{morefloats} command twice, you continue to get the
\texttt{Too many unprocessed floats} error, there are a couple things you can
do.

The \doccmddef{FloatBarrier} command will immediately process all the floats
before typesetting more material.  Since \doccmd{FloatBarrier} will start a new
paragraph, you should place this command at the beginning or end of a
paragraph.

The \doccmddef{clearpage} command will also process the floats before
continuing, but instead of starting a new paragraph, it will start a new page.

You can also try moving your floats around a bit: move a figure or table to the
next page or reduce the number of sidenotes.  (Each sidenote actually uses
\emph{two} slots.)

After the floats have placed, \LaTeX{} will mark those slots as unused so they
are available for the next page to be composed.

\section{Captions}
You may notice that the captions are sometimes misaligned.
Due to the way \LaTeX's float mechanism works, we can't know for sure where it
decided to put a float. Therefore, the \TL document classes provide commands to
override the caption position.

\paragraph{Vertical alignment} To override the vertical alignment, use the
\doccmd{setfloatalignment} command inside the float environment.  For
example:

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{docspec}
  \textbackslash begin\{figure\}[btp]\\
  \qquad \textbackslash includegraphics\{sinewave\}\\
  \qquad \textbackslash caption\{This is an example of a sine wave.\}\\
  \qquad \textbackslash label\{fig:sinewave\}\\
  \qquad \hlred{\textbackslash setfloatalignment\{b\}\% forces caption to be bottom-aligned}\\
  \textbackslash end\{figure\}
\end{docspec}
\end{fullwidth}

\noindent The syntax of the \doccmddef{setfloatalignment} command is:

\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{setfloatalignment}\{\docopt{pos}\}
\end{docspec}

\noindent where \docopt{pos} can be either \texttt{b} for bottom-aligned
captions, or \texttt{t} for top-aligned captions.

\paragraph{Horizontal alignment}\label{par:overriding-horizontal}
To override the horizontal alignment, use either the \doccmd{forceversofloat}
or the \doccmd{forcerectofloat} command inside of the float environment.  For
example:

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{docspec}
  \textbackslash begin\{figure\}[btp]\\
  \qquad \textbackslash includegraphics\{sinewave\}\\
  \qquad \textbackslash caption\{This is an example of a sine wave.\}\\
  \qquad \textbackslash label\{fig:sinewave\}\\
  \qquad \hlred{\textbackslash forceversofloat\% forces caption to be set to the left of the float}\\
  \textbackslash end\{figure\}
\end{docspec}
\end{fullwidth}

The \doccmddef{forceversofloat} command causes the algorithm to assume the
float has been placed on a verso page---that is, a page on the left side of a
two-page spread.  Conversely, the \doccmddef{forcerectofloat} command causes
the algorithm to assume the float has been placed on a recto page---that is, a
page on the right side of a two-page spread.


\section{Full-width text blocks}

In addition to the new float types, there is a \docenvdef{fullwidth}
environment that stretches across the main text block and the sidenotes
area.

\begin{Verbatim}
\begin{fullwidth}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
\end{fullwidth}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{fullwidth}
\small\itshape\lipsum[1]
\end{fullwidth}

\section{Typography}\label{sec:typography}

\subsection{Typefaces}\label{sec:typefaces}\index{typefaces}
If the Palatino, \textsf{Helvetica}, and \texttt{Bera Mono} typefaces are installed, this style
will use them automatically.  Otherwise, we'll fall back on the Computer Modern
typefaces.

\subsection{Letterspacing}\label{sec:letterspacing}
This document class includes two new commands and some improvements on
existing commands for letterspacing.

When setting strings of \allcaps{ALL CAPS} or \smallcaps{small caps}, the
letter\-spacing---that is, the spacing between the letters---should be
% increased slightly.\cite{Bringhurst2005}  The \doccmddef{allcaps} command has proper letterspacing for
strings of \allcaps{FULL CAPITAL LETTERS}, and the \doccmddef{smallcaps} command
has letterspacing for \smallcaps{small capital letters}.  These commands
will also automatically convert the case of the text to upper- or
lowercase, respectively.

The \doccmddef{textsc} command has also been redefined to include
letterspacing.  The case of the \doccmd{textsc} argument is left as is,
however.  This allows one to use both uppercase and lowercase letters:
\textsc{The Initial Letters Of The Words In This Sentence Are Capitalized.}



\section{Document Class Options}\label{sec:options}

\index{class options|(}
The \doccls{tufte-book} class is based on the \LaTeX\ \doccls{book}
document class.  Therefore, you can pass any of the typical book
options.  There are a few options that are specific to the
\doccls{tufte-book} document class, however.

The \docclsoptdef{a4paper} option will set the paper size to \smallcaps{A4} instead of
the default \smallcaps{US} letter size.

The \docclsoptdef{sfsidenotes} option will set the sidenotes and title block in a 
\textsf{sans serif} typeface instead of the default roman.

The \docclsoptdef{twoside} option will modify the running heads so that the page
number is printed on the outside edge (as opposed to always printing the page
number on the right-side edge in \docclsoptdef{oneside} mode).  

The \docclsoptdef{symmetric} option typesets the sidenotes on the outside edge of
the page.  This is how books are traditionally printed, but is contrary to
Tufte's book design which sets the sidenotes on the right side of the page.
This option implicitly sets the \docclsopt{twoside} option.

The \docclsoptdef{justified} option sets all the text fully justified (flush left
and right).  The default is to set the text ragged right.  
The body text of Tufte's books are set ragged right.  This prevents
needless hyphenation and makes it easier to read the text in the slightly
narrower column.

The \docclsoptdef{bidi} option loads the \docpkg{bidi} package which is used with
\tXeLaTeX\ to typeset bi-directional text.  Since the \docpkg{bidi}
package needs to be loaded before the sidenotes and cite commands are defined,
it can't be loaded in the document preamble.

The \docclsoptdef{debug} option causes the \TL classes to output debug
information to the log file which is useful in troubleshooting bugs.  It will
also cause the graphics to be replaced by outlines.

The \docclsoptdef{nofonts} option prevents the \TL classes from
automatically loading the Palatino and Helvetica typefaces.  You should use
this option if you wish to load your own fonts.  If you're using \tXeLaTeX, this
option is implied (\ie, the Palatino and Helvetica fonts aren't loaded if you
use \tXeLaTeX).  

The \docclsoptdef{nols} option inhibits the letterspacing code.  The \TL\
classes try to load the appropriate letterspacing package (either pdf\TeX's
\docpkg{letterspace} package or the \docpkg{soul} package).  If you're using
\tXeLaTeX\ with \docpkg{fontenc}, however, you should configure your own
letterspacing.  

The \docclsoptdef{notitlepage} option causes \doccmd{maketitle} to generate a title
block instead of a title page.  The \doccls{book} class defaults to a title
page and the \doccls{handout} class defaults to the title block.  There is an
analogous \docclsoptdef{titlepage} option that forces \doccmd{maketitle} to
generate a full title page instead of the title block.

The \docclsoptdef{notoc} option suppresses \TL's custom table of contents
(\textsc{toc}) design.  The current \textsc{toc} design only shows unnumbered
chapter titles; it doesn't show sections or subsections.  The \docclsopt{notoc}
option will revert to \LaTeX's \textsc{toc} design.

The \docclsoptdef{nohyper} option prevents the \docpkg{hyperref} package from
being loaded.  The default is to load the \docpkg{hyperref} package and use the
\doccmd{title} and \doccmd{author} contents as metadata for the generated
\textsc{pdf}.

\chapter{Discussion and Outlook}
\label{ch:discussion_outlook}

The \TL document classes are designed to closely emulate Tufte's book
design by default.  However, each document is different and you may encounter
situations where the default settings are insufficient.  This chapter explores
many of the ways you can adjust the \TL document classes to better fit
your needs.

\section{File Hooks}
\label{sec:filehooks}

\index{file hooks|(}
If you create many documents using the \TL classes, it's easier to
store your customizations in a separate file instead of copying them into the
preamble of each document.  The \TL classes provide three file hooks:
\docfilehook{tufte-common-local.tex}{common}, \docfilehook{tufte-book-local.tex}{book}, and
\docfilehook{tufte-handout-local.tex}{handout}.\sloppy

\begin{description}
  \item[\docfilehook{tufte-common-local.tex}{common}]
    If this file exists, it will be loaded by all of the \TL document
    classes just prior to any document-class-specific code.  If your
    customizations or code should be included in both the book and handout
    classes, use this file hook.
  \item[\docfilehook{tufte-book-local.tex}{book}] 
    If this file exists, it will be loaded after all of the common and
    book-specific code has been read.  If your customizations apply only to the
    book class, use this file hook.
  \item[\docfilehook{tufte-common-handout.tex}{handout}] 
    If this file exists, it will be loaded after all of the common and
    handout-specific code has been read.  If your customizations apply only to
    the handout class, use this file hook.
