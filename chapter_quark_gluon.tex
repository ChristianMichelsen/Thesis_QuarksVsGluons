\section{Sidenotes}\label{sec:sidenotes}
One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the
extensive use of sidenotes.  There is a wide margin to provide ample room
for sidenotes and small figures.  Any \doccmd{footnote}s will automatically
be converted to sidenotes.\footnote{This is a sidenote that was entered
using the \texttt{\textbackslash footnote} command.}  If you'd like to place ancillary
information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript
number), you can use the \doccmd{marginnote} command.\marginnote{This is a
margin note.  Notice that there isn't a number preceding the note, and
there is no number in the main text where this note was written.}

In blue colors the variables are shown for \textcolor{blue}{true b-jets}, in red for \textcolor{red}{true c-jets}, in green for \textcolor{green}{true g-jets}, and in orange for \textcolor{orange}{all of the jets} (including non q-matched). In fully opaque color are shown the distributions for 2-jet events, in dashed (and lighter color) 3-jet events, and in semi-transparent 4-jet events. Notice the logarithmic y-axis, that there are no g-jets for 2-jet events (as expected), and that all of the distributions are very similar not matter how many jets.
