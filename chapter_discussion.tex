\label{ch:discussion_outlook}

The \TL document classes are designed to closely emulate Tufte's book
design by default.  However, each document is different and you may encounter
situations where the default settings are insufficient.  This chapter explores
many of the ways you can adjust the \TL document classes to better fit
your needs.
