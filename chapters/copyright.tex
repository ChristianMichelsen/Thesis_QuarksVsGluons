This thesis was inspired by the works of Edward R. Tufte and is based on the Tufte-\LaTeX\xspace package. 


\noindent The front page shows the UMAP visualization of 4-jet events in electron-positron collisions at LEP measured by the ALEPH detector using the vertex variables, see Figure~\ref{fig:q:UMAP_vertex_4j}. This figure is overlaid a photograph of a bubble chamber showing a pion decay \autocite{desyBubbleChamberPhotograph}.
